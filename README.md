# Latex Collaboration Guide

We maintain styles, classes, bibliographies, and shared resources not available via the TeX distribution in repositories in our github organization.

## Collaborative writing in LaTeX

To minimize conflicts when writing, we partition a document into several files,
usually
one header file, simply called `paper.tex` (though other variants like `main.tex` are also in use),
that imports
one file per section, along with possibly further files for figures, tables, programs and alike,
often gathered in corresponding folders (we suggest `include/<name>`).
To this end, we provide a rough [paper template] for LaTeX that is also available when setting up a new repository.

We view a LaTeX document as source code and try to format it for readability.
For instance, we start a new line with each sentence and
sometimes break sentences into several lines to reflect their logical contents.

### Macros

The set of [LaTeX macros] used in the Potassco book is available (but not in general use).

### Affiliation

Our university guideline foresees that our First- and Lastname are followed by **University of Potsdam**.
Unless required, we usually do not provide further details (after all there's Google).

### Presentations

We have created a [slide template] for presentations prepared with LaTeX' [beamer] style;
this is also available when setting up a new repository.

Moreover, it comes with a submodule containing [logos].

## Version Control

For collaborative writing we follow the [feature branch workflow]
and use submodules for including styles, classes, bibliographies, or shared resources,
as described below.

Best read the [Pro Git book], at least the first chapters.

### Using Submodules

Do not copy styles, classes, bibliographies, or shared resources into a git repository.
Use Git submodules within your paper repositories, instead.
Conceptually, this means that Git will maintain a files from another repository within a subdirectory of your own repository (we suggest `include/<name>`).

Git submodules are always locked to a specific commit.
In other words, a submodule won’t automatically update itself, even when pulling in the latest changes of your paper repository.
You’ll have to manually update the submodule whenever necessary.

On another note, never edit the content of the submodule directly, that is, within `include/<name>`.
If you need modify the files in a submodule, clone it to a location outside of your paper repository and contribute from there.

Read more about Git submodules on the [GitHub Blog][github-blog-git-submodules] and the in [Pro Git book][pro-git-book-git-submodules].

### Using Submodules with LaTeX

By default, the LaTeX toolchain won’t attempt to look for styles, classes, and bibliographies in subfolders.
If you build your paper with [`latexmk`][latexmk] (we can only recommend that), this can be easily solved.
Simply copy the [`.latexmkrc`][.latexmkrc] file to the top level of your repository,
and LaTeX will automatically find any styles, classes, and bibliographies in the `include` folder if you run with `latexmk`:
```sh
$ latexmk -pdf paper.tex
```

If you do not use `latexmk`, you need to set the following environment variables in your `.bashrc` or LaTeX IDE instead:
```sh
export BIBINPUTS="./include//:"
export BSTINPUTS="./include//:"
export TEXINPUTS="./include//:"
```

### Adding Submodules

Add the repository as a submodule to your paper repository as follows:
```sh
$ git submodule add ../<name> include/<name>
```
If your repository is hosted outside of the [`krr-up` organization][krr-up], replace `../<name>` with `https://github.com/krr-up/<name>` (to use https access) or with `git@github.com:krr-up/<name>.git` (to use ssh access). Using ssh avoids being request the password.

Next, commit and push the changes to make the submodule available to your coworkers.
After your coworkers have pulled the change, they will need to execute the following command:
```sh
$ git submodule update --init --recursive
```

The submodule will now stay at the latest state of the `master` branch at the time of adding it unless manually updated later on.

### Updating Submodules

You can bring the latest changes to your paper repository as follows:

```sh
$ cd include/<name>
$ git fetch
$ git reset --hard origin/master
$ cd ../..
$ git add include/<name>
$ git commit -m "Update <name>"
$ git push
```

Finally, keep in mind that you need to run
```sh
$ git submodule update --init --recursive
```
every time one of the following happens:
- You clone your paper repository from scratch.
- Someone else updates the submodule to to a newer version.
- Files in `include/<name>` are missing or LaTeX complains about them.
- `git status` tells you `modified: include/<name> (new commits)` and you didn’t expect this.
- Someone else adds a new submodule to your paper repository.
